## Take Action

Welcome to the Take Action page. Here, we compile various resources where you can learn about community alternatives that residents and advocates are pursuing to protect existing communities and to expand on opportunities that make housing attainable to low-income individuals and households. This page is a place where users can review materials for teaching with Leontina Hormelâ€™s book Trailer Park America: Reimagining Working-Class Communities and for teaching more generally about housing and community development.
